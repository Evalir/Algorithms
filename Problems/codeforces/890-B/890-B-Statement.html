   <p>Vlad likes to eat in cafes very much. During his life, he has visited cafes <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> times. Unfortunately, Vlad started to feel that his last visits are not any different from each other. To fix that Vlad had a small research.</p>
   <p>First of all, Vlad assigned individual indices to all cafes. Then, he wrote down indices of cafes he visited in a row, in order of visiting them. Now, Vlad wants to find such a cafe that his last visit to that cafe was before his last visits to every other cafe. In other words, he wants to find such a cafe that he hasn't been there for as long as possible. Help Vlad to find that cafe.</p>

   <p>In first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices <span class="tex-span">1</span> and <span class="tex-span">2</span> were after the last visit to cafe with index <span class="tex-span">3</span>; so this cafe is the answer. </p>
   <p>In second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices <span class="tex-span">1</span>, <span class="tex-span">2</span> and <span class="tex-span">4</span>. Cafes with indices <span class="tex-span">1</span> and <span class="tex-span">4</span> were visited after the last visit of cafe with index <span class="tex-span">2</span>, so the answer is <span class="tex-span">2</span>. Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.</p>
