# Info for tricks

Two pointers is a technique used for being able to have two "indexes" that can move left to right. It's useful for finding things like maximum contiguous subsequence, A pair of lements that sum N, etc.

##Implementation

-Declare L and R.
- Using nested for or while, use L and R (Both until N, and R until L).
